# Stable Fluids
Third year programming assignment, original cpu solver[https://github.com/finallyjustice/stablefluids]

## Configuration
The following environment variables are needed to compile this out of the box:
* CUDA_PATH : Needs to point to the base directory of your cuda lib and includes
* CUDA_ARCH : Your local device compute (e.g. 30 or 52 or whatever)
* HOST_COMPILER : Your local g++ compiler (compatible with cuda compiles, g++ 4.9)
